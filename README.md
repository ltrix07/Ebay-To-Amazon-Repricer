# Ebay-To-Amazon-Repricer
A service for automatically updating Amazon prices based on fresh eBay market data.

This project works together with **[Ebay-Checker](https://github.com/ltrix07/Ebay-Checker)** as part of a two-step pricing automation pipeline:

1. **Ebay-Checker** crawls eBay listings, collects up-to-date product information, and writes the results to a table.
2. **Ebay-To-Amazon-Repricer** reads that table, calculates new prices using predefined pricing rules, and updates the prices on Amazon through SP-API.

## 📌 Purpose

The goal is to automate repricing on Amazon based on real-time competitor data from eBay.

The system helps to:
- keep Amazon prices competitive,
- maintain desired profit margins,
- avoid manual recalculation and updating of prices,
- keep the catalog synchronized with the eBay market.

This tool is a lightweight alternative to commercial repricing software and is fully customizable.

## 🔗 Integration with Ebay-Checker

The workflow assumes that the output table is generated by  
➡ **[`Ebay-Checker`](https://github.com/ltrix07/Ebay-Checker)**.

### Typical pipeline:

1. **Ebay-Checker**:
   - scans all eBay items,
   - extracts and refreshes important product data,
   - saves everything into a table (CSV/Excel/Sheets).

2. **Ebay-To-Amazon-Repricer**:
   - reads that updated table (path configured in `params.py`),
   - applies pricing rules (markup, min/max margin, rounding, etc.),
   - updates prices on Amazon via SP-API.
